As a Pei Chun village, we take every opportunity to show appreciation and gratitude to others who had helped us. Thus, we would like to invite all of you to pen a little note to any staff who might have touched hearts, showed concern for you or have impacted you in your learning and character development.

We hope that you could share with us ways in which the teacher/support staff has:

* shown care and concern for you or your class (or your child/ward);
* demonstrated great passion, or motivated you (or your child/ward) in the subject that he/she is teaching;
* provided great support and service; and
* partnered well with you in nurturing your child/ward together.
