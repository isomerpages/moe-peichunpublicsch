**Curriculum**

The Mathematics curriculum in Pei Chun Public School follows the Primary Mathematics Syllabus conceptualized by MOE, Singapore. The curriculum emphasizes conceptual understanding, skill proficiencies and thinking skills in the teaching and learning of mathematics.

At the heart of the framework is mathematical problem solving which is dependent on the five inter-related components of Concepts, Skills, Processes, Attitudes and Metacognition. The learning of mathematics involves the acquisition of concepts and skills, an understanding of the underlying mathematical thinking and the general strategies of problem solving. Making the learning fun and relevant goes a long way to inculcating positive attitude and appreciating mathematics as an important and powerful tool in everyday life.

**Instruction**

Our philosophy of mathematics instruction goes beyond the teaching of mathematical knowledge and concepts per se. In educating pupils, we want them to make mathematical sense of the real world they live in and apply what they learn to solve real-life problems. We aim to develop our students into critical thinkers and confident problem solvers.

The teaching and learning approaches incorporate activity-based and learner-centred methodologies. Pei Chun adopts the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) approach to the teaching and learning of mathematics. Research has shown that pupils learn mathematics more effectively when they see the connection between the Concrete, Pictorial and Abstract.

Mathematical problem solving is central to mathematics learning. It involves the acquisition and application of mathematics concepts and skills in a wide range of situations, including non-routine, open-ended and real-world problems. To become effective and efficient problem solvers, our pupils learn and apply George Pólya’s 4-stage approach to problem-solving.

To cater to the different learning needs of our pupils, the following activities and programmes are put in place:

*   Learning Support Mathematics (LSM) Programme for Primary 1 & 2
*   Remediation Programme for P3 – P6
*   Mathematics Olympiad for P4 – P6
*   E2K Programme for P4 & P5
*   P1 & P2 Adventure Day (in collaboration with English Department)
*   Recess Programmes for P1 to P6 – Fun-Matics & Celebration of Learning
*   Koobits E-learning Platform for P1 to P6

**Assessments**

Assessments are aligned to what pupils have learnt. Various modes of assessment such as pen-and-paper tests, performance tasks and journal writing are used to provide pupils opportunities to self-assess their learning and thinking process, to reflect on their strengths and weaknesses and what they can do to improve their learning. The assessments also provide feedback on pupils’ learning, their progress and allows for identification of misconceptions and areas for further instruction.
