**Curriculum**

The Aesthetics programme in Pei Chun Public School aims to develop our pupils in the Head (Knowledge), Heart (Attitude) and Hand (Skills).

In Art, pupils develop themselves in art techniques, visual inquiry skills, research and processing skills and communication skills through their involvement in various art projects. The elements of art and principles of design are explored through various art forms (e.g. 2-D and 3-D fine art, digital media). The values expounded through the Art curriculum helps pupils to appreciate Art as a powerful and purposeful communication tool to capture imagination and express human emotions. They will understand that Art plays a strong role in society and culture.

In Music, pupils explore a range of music elements and concepts and gain understanding of the vast range of musical instruments through various learning experiences. Pupils develop their musical abilities based on the premise that all children are musical and have the innate ability to listen, sing, dance, play and express themselves musically. The processes involved in music performing and creating develop skills such as listening skills, fine motor skills, creative thinking skills and social skills. They will also understand music in local and global cultures. The music curriculum provides opportunities for pupils to develop a connection to music and the foundation for an informed and life-long involvement in music.

With a strong emphasis on multicultural education, the programme seeks to develop in our pupils to be concerned citizens with social awareness, equipped with civic literacy, global awareness and cross-cultural skills.

**Instruction**

In Excursion programmes, the school expands the learning environment of the pupils by bringing them to professional concerts, or visit museums, galleries and theatres. This will expose pupils to professional expertise and promote greater appreciation of the arts and the role it plays in our society.

The Aesthetics Programme promotes the learning of the arts through the pupils’ active engagement in three different programme types – Exposure, Experience and Excursion. Aligned to the structure adopted by the NAC – Arts Education Programme, it aims to provide quality learning experiences to suit the diverse learning needs of our pupils.

In Exposure programmes, pupils are introduced to an array of art forms through programmes like assembly performances and talks or peer performances and exhibitions during recess. The objective of such programmes is to give pupils a basic understanding of the myriad possibility of the arts and its expressive potential as presented by professionals in the field or their peers. Pupils appreciate the arts and are encouraged to pursue a meaningful and life-long involvement in it.

In Experience programmes, pupils learn through hands-on participation in various arts forms. Besides acquiring knowledge in the disciplines, they also develop skills in the respective subject areas and expand their ability to think creatively. A student-centric approach is adopted to promote process-driven classroom experiences. Through the approach, pupils are equipped with the 21st century competencies like critical and inventive thinking, information and communication skills and self-confidence.

**Assessment**

Purposeful assessment is conducted regularly to monitor, evaluate and ascertain pupils’ progress and achievement in the learning of the arts. The programme focuses a lot on formative assessments, which provides useful information on the pupils’ strengths and areas for improvement, allowing teachers to review their teaching and plan their further instruction. Such formative assessments culminate into summative assessments at the end of each semester. Teachers are guided by assessment rubrics throughout the year as they guide the pupils in their learning.

The modes of assessment include:  
• Artworks  
• Practical performances / presentations  
• Peer assessment  
• Self-assessment  
• Teacher observation  
• Oral questioning
