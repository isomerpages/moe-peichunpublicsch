**Curriculum**

The twin goals of Science Education in Singapore are to enthuse and nurture scientifically literate students who can make informed decisions and to provide strong Science fundamentals for students to innovate and pursue STEM for future learning and work. These goals are represented by the tagline Science for Life and Society and are central to the revised Science Curriculum Framework.

In line with the framework, the Science Department aims to inspire students to seek scientific knowledge and understanding with application, develop skills and attitudes for scientific inquiry and innovation, and build their foundation in scientific ethics.

This is achieved through the provision of a Science learning environment that would equip students with competencies to meet the challenges of the 21st Century through the integration of social emotional learning, ICT, self-directed and collaborative learning in the teaching of Science.

We seek to nurture the students’ natural curiosity in science and the natural world. Using the inquiry-based and hands-on exploratory approach, students will be engaged during lessons and develop a love for the subject. Students will have the opportunity to observe characteristics of live specimens, life cycle of plants and animals and other interesting experiments. They will also have the opportunity to go on different learnings journeys to bring their learning beyond the classroom.

Apart from the core curriculum, students have other opportunities to pursue their interest in science, such as Pei Chun Creative Toy Competition, Science Olympiad, enrichment programmes and Co-curricular Activities, like Science and Gardening Club.

**Instruction**

The Science Department takes an inquiry-based approach to the teaching and learning of science. In this way, students become engaged and excited about what they are studying and they then become motivated to learn.

Programmes, both in- and out-of-classroom, and learning resources are tailored to enrich the diverse learning experiences for our students.

Learning experiences are based in realistic contexts so that students can make connections with their own lives and the environment in which they live.

**Assessment**

To provide students with richer and more holistic feedback on their development and skills acquisition, the Science Department uses formative assessments in addition to the weighted assessments and semestral assessments to assess students’ learning. Examples of formative assessments include the following:

*   Practical tests
*   Group projects and presentations to develop the 21st century competencies
*   Teachers’ observations to provide valuable feedback on the learning outcomes

Such formative assessment practices also serve as instructional intervention strategies designed to motivate, and not merely monitor, students’ learning. Through a student-centric and values-driven science education, we are committed to what we teach, how we teach and how we know our students are learning, infusing ethics and values in the process. We are confident that our Science education will provide a strong foundation to help our students become confident children, independent learners and caring citizens.
