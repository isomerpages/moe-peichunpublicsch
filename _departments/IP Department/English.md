**Curriculum**

The English Language department in Pei Chun Public School is committed to developing our students to be confident and competent communicators through the use of well-established, learner-centred and developmentally appropriate pedagogical approaches using authentic children’s literature. The English language curriculum is based on the STELLAR (Strategies for English Language Learning And Reading) Programme developed by the Ministry of Education (MOE). This programme aims to strengthen children’s language and reading skills as well as promote a positive attitude towards learning in the foundational years.

There are various differentiated programmes to better cater to the learning abilities of our students during curriculum time. Teachers use more interactive methods such as Readers’ Theatre, Show-and-Tell and Pick-and-Tell to boost students’ communication skills by helping them learn the language in context. They are also taught how to make use of authentic print and non-print materials in the learning of the language. Essential skills such as communication skills, collaborative skills and thinking skills are incorporated in classroom activities to maximize the pupils’ full learning potential.

**Instruction**

**Experiential Learning**

The English Department believes that experiential learning creates deep impression on students’ acquisition of knowledge. According to John Dewey’s theory of education, humans learn something from every experience and that such experiences influence the nature of one’s future experiences. The following are examples of level-wide experiential learning through the STELLAR curriculum:

*   P1: Neighbourhood Walk Learning Journey (integration with NE/SS)
*   P3: Learning Journey to HDB Gallery Livingspace

**Reading Programme**

Reading is an essential means from which pupils gain world knowledge, develop their fluency of ideas and improve their vocabulary in context. The following school wide extensive reading programme aims to develop in pupils a love for reading.

*   P1 to P3: Use of Graded Readers
*   P4 to P6: Use of Newspapers (What’s Up and Little Red Dot)
*   P1 to P6: IREAD Programme and activities

IREAD is a school-wide reading programme implemented through the joint curriculum innovation and collaboration by the three departments: English, Chinese and ICT. The programme consists of activity-based tasks designed to develop information literacy and media literacy competencies that spans across a six-year curriculum.

**Learning Support Programme (LSP)**  
The LSP is an early intervention programme which aims at providing additional support to selected Primary 1 pupils who are weak in the English Language and literacy skills.

**School-based Dyslexia Remediation (SDR)**

The SDR is a two-year intervention programme for Primary 3 and 4 students. These students are identified for support through a systematic screening process for dyslexia conducted at the end of Primary 2. It is conducted in small groups by specially-trained school personnel and relies on a systemic set of strategies and activities which have been carefully designed by MOE. This programme aims to help bridge the gap between these students who struggle with reading and spelling and their peers.

**Reading Remediation Programme (RRP)**

The RRP is a two-year intervention programme which aims to provide support for Primary 3 and 4 students who still face consistent difficulties in reading in the English Language despite having completed the Learning Support Programme in Primary 1 and 2. The programme exposes students to a range of coping strategies for reading comprehension which will enable them to better manage their learning in the regular classroom.

The LSP, SDR and RRP are intensive support programmes to help students level up their literacy skills so they can cope with the demands of the mainstream curriculum. As these students also join their form class for the formal curriculum lessons, they concurrently benefit from wider social interactions and learning among their peers.

**Writing Strategy**

The EL teachers adopt various strategies for the different phases of writing, from pre-writing to writing to revision and eventually, publishing. Some strategies of pre-writing includes quick-write which will be used in conjunction with the writing journal. For writing, draw-label-caption is a technique for creating an effective lead and appropriate conclusions-writing will be taught to our students as well. Equipped with these skills, our students will be developed to be proficient and confident writers.

**Assessment**The English Department has adopted PERI Holistic Assessment (HA) to assess and monitor students’ learning and progress in terms of their competency in the acquisition of the language. Primary 1 and 2 students are assessed based on 8 learning outcomes stipulated by MOE. Weighted Assessment aims to provide qualitative and quantitative feedback to support and guide the student’s development. It also informs teachers on their teaching practice and guides them in the design and delivery of student learning. It will also enable parents to support their children’s development and growth. EL Assessment focuses on Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing. Diagnostic, formative and summative assessments are administered on a regular basis to pace the learning of our students. Performance Feedback form, self and peer feedback form and pen-and-paper assessments supports students’ learning and development, and increases teacher confidence in delivering quality classroom assessment.
