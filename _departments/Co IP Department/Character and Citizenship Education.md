The new CCE syllabus is anchored on core values, social and emotional competencies, and skills related to character and citizenship development. CCE lessons are based on the life experiences that our pupils go through, drawing out values and skills appropriate at their developmental stage.

**National Education (NE) Core Events**

NE develops national cohesion, cultivate the instinct for survival as a nation and instil in our students, confidence in our nation’s future. It also emphasises the cultivation of a sense of belonging and emotional rootedness to Singapore. National Education is part of a holistic education. It aims to develop national cohesion, cultivate the instinct for survival as a nation and instil in our students, confidence in our nation’s future. It also emphasises on cultivating a sense of belonging and emotional rootedness to Singapore. Every year, the school commemorates four NE Core events: Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day, with focus on ‘Cherishing the Past’, ‘Celebrating the Present’ and ‘Creating the Future’. ‘Cherishing the Past’ allows our pupils and staff to understand the importance and significance of these events. ‘Celebrating the Present’ makes us take stock of how far we have come and indeed celebrate our progress. ‘Creating the Future’ empowers our pupils and staff on what they can do to ensure that we as a country can continue to make progress and scale a higher level.

**Social Studies (SS)**

The Social Studies curriculum aims to develop the civic competencies of our pupils. Civic competencies, which encompass the body of knowledge, skills and values expressed in the Philosophy of SS, will empower students to be informed, concerned and participative citizens.

To be in line with the Social Studies Curriculum, Learning Journey / Field-based Learning are designed to meet the learning needs of our pupils at different levels.

*   P1 and P2: Home and School.
*   P3 and P4: School and Community.
*   P5 and P6: Country and the World.

**Values-in-Action (ViA)**

Values-in-Action is a critical part of Citizenship Education as it strives to build social cohesion and inculcate civic responsibility. ViA aslo provides the platform for all Pei Chun students to demonstrate their leadership competencies. The school has developed a 6-year ViA Curriculum that seeks to develop knowledge, skills and values progressively in each domain from P1 to P6, and at the same time, growing their leadership competencies from self to social and to thought leadership.

**Instruction**

**Character Education**

The school adopts a whole school approach to broaden students’ experiences in character, citizenship and leadership development. The CCE Curriculum focuses on using the 3Hs (Educating the Heads, Engaging the Hearts and Empowering the Hands) approach to equip pupils with the requisite knowledge, skills and attitudes/values necessary to develop them to be Passionate and Collaborative Learners, Patriotic and Caring Citizens, Proactive and Creative Leaders. Age-appropriate learning experiences are created for pupils to apply the values they have learnt, make decisions and act on them in a responsible way.

**Social Studies**

Social Studies aims to prepare our pupils to be citizens of tomorrow by helping them to understand the interconnectedness of Singapore and the world we live in. Through inquiry and authentic learning experiences, we seek to inspire mental eagerness and ignite a curiosity to inquire about real world issues that concerns their lives. With opportunities to involve our pupils in investigating and inquiring during lessons, our pupils will gain better understanding on the complexities of the real world, the Social Studies curriculum equips our pupils with the knowledge, skills and values that would allow them to succeed at becoming effective citizens, workers and leaders in the 21 century.

Field-based learning allows the pupils to contextualize their learning experience in an authentic real-world setting, thus enabling the relational learning of concepts and content. Pupils would also be able to conduct hands-on exploration in a focused area of study, thus being engaged in multi-sensory modes. As part of engaging pupils’ interest in inquiry, field-based learning would also motivate and sustain their interest in the subject matter as pupils would learn to explore, construct new knowledge and make connections to the topic being studied.

**Assessment**

Through the use of assessment tools such as self assessment, rubrics, checklists and reflections, assessment of Character and Citizenship Education includes monitoring and providing developmental feedback to pupils’ on their understanding and acquisition of knowledge, skills and values.

Teachers provide feedback to every child using the Values Matrix, which forms the basis of assessment of the Conduct Grade that is assigned to every child at mid-year and the end of year, as well as the Personal Qualities grading that is assigned at the end of the year. In addition, P3 to P6 students are required to complete a self-assessment using the Values Matrix to reflect on their development in each of the Pei Chun values. This promotes ownership and responsibility on the part of the students in their character and leadership development.

**Social Studies**

SS is a non-examinable subject at the primary level. Assessment is, however, important to help monitor pupils’ progress in their learning of Social Studies. To evaluate and support pupils’ learning, the methods of assessment used are Assessment for Learning (AfL), and Assessment of Learning (AoL).

AfL refers to the use of assessment to support learning. It is used to shape teaching and learning in ways that help pupils master learning goals and teachers improve practices. For these reasons, it is formative in nature, takes place all the time in the classroom and is a process that is embedded in instruction.

AoL refers to the use of assessment as a means to evaluate if curricular outcomes have been met. It is used primarily for accountability purposes – grading, ranking and certification. For these reasons, it tends to be summative in nature and is carried out quarterly.

For the purpose of reporting, a letter grade will be awarded for the assessment of SS at the end of each year.
