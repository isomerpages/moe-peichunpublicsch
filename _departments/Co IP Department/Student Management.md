Student Management
------------------

_Updated on 29 June 2021._

**Student Management Department**

**Discipline**

In Pei Chun, we adopt an educative approach which involves all school personnel to support and care for our students. This approach empowers our students to be actively involved in their character development. In enacting a positive and proactive approach to discipline, the school strives to:

*   **_Promote_** a safe and supportive environment and a culture of care, and **_prevent_**challenging behaviours from occurring;
*   **_Address_** inappropriate behaviour promptly, and **_correct_** it before it affects students’ development and well-being;
*   **_Replace_** inappropriate behaviour with prosocial, appropriate ones, and **_restore_** relationships with others hurt by their actions.   

Our school establishes rules and regulations for promoting good behaviour and ensuring a safe and conducive environment for the overall development of students. Parents/ Guardians can refer to the Student Diary & Handbook for our set of school rules and regulations, and list of consequences.

**Supporting students with additional needs**

The school also believes that every student can learn. In Pei Chun, we have specialized personnel and programmes to provide timely and appropriate support to students with additional needs to achieve their full potential:   

*   **_Learning, behaviour and/ or emotional support_** provided by our specialized team of Allied Educators/ Learning and Behavioural and School Counsellors. This is in the form of individual or small group intervention or skills training.
*   **_School p_****_rogrammes_**: Learning Support Programme (P1 & P2), School-based Dyslexia Remediation Programme (P3 & P4), A.C.E for Life Programme (P5), Managing Emotions Workshop (P6) to provide targeted support for these students.
*   **_Partnering and engaging_** with stakeholders (parents and the community, including collaboration with and referral to external agencies) in order to better support these students.
