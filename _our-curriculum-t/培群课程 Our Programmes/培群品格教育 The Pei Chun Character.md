Character Education has always been the heart of Pei Chun’s education. The school values (Passion, Teamwork, Respect, Care, Initiative and Innovation) and motto (Courtesy, Justice, Honesty, Honour and Gratitude) are fundamental for a person of good character and socially responsible citizen. They guide students to discern between right and wrong, help them to make responsible choices and become more aware of their roles in society.  

品格教育一向是培群体系的核心。培群的学生以学校的价值观（热爱学习、团结互助、相互尊重、关爱他人、积极主动和发挥创意）与校训（礼义廉耻和饮水思源）为基础，指引他们明辨是非，帮助他们做出负责任的决定，并认清自己在社会上所扮演的角色。
