After School Remedial Programme (RP) – P3 to P6 

The school is always committed to support our students in their journey of acquiring knowledge and skills. The school adopts a targeted approach to support students who did not meet the minimum requirements or are underperforming in the subject. Only selected students will be requested to stay back after school for RP on Tuesdays and/or Thursdays from 2 pm to 3 pm.

The objective of this programme is to close students’ learning gaps so as to enable them to achieve better progress in their learning. Thus, the class size for the remedial lessons is kept small to ensure effective remediation. Remedial lessons are not an extension of the school curriculum. Rather, they will focus on the mastery of the concepts/topics taught.

The list of students who are required to attend the RP will be reviewed every semester. Teachers will monitor the performance of the students closely and students will be discharged from the RP when they have demonstrated the ability to keep up with the pace of learning in class.  

The Remediation Programme will start in:

If your child/ward is identified to attend the RP, he/she will receive a consent form and the detailed schedule of the weekly remedial lessons from the Form Teacher.  Please make the necessary arrangements (e.g. transportation and lunch) for your child/ward to attend these lessons as show:

We seek your cooperation to inform your child’s/ward’s remedial subject teacher(s) if your child/ward needs to be excused from any remedial lesson as attendance will be taken.

Programme for other students not in the Remediation Programme
For the rest of the students who are managing well in their subjects, the school will be conceptualising enrichment programmes for them. It will be modular and are on an opt-in basis. The focus of these modular enrichment programmes will be to expose students to learning beyond grades and examinations. More details will be provided at a later time.

RP takes precedence over enrichment programme. If your child/ward is selected for RP, they will have to give up their place in the enrichment programme.

For clarifications, please contact your child’s/ward’s Form Teacher or Mrs Seah Li Li at 65053519 or [goh_li_li@moe.edu.sg](goh_li_li@moe.edu.sg).
