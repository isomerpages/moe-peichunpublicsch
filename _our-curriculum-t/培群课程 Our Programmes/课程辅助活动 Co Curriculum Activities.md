The CCA Programme provides students with a platform to discover their interests and talents. Well-organised and implemented, they can fuel in the individual a life-long love for a particular activity, be it a sport or a musical pursuit. CCA also offer excellent platforms for students to learn core values, social and emotional competencies and the emerging 21st Century Competencies. These help the individual to lead a balanced life in adulthood. 
Our Primary 3 students get the opportunity to participate in a CCA Experience Programme, from which they can experience up to 3 CCAs over a span of a few weeks. This will help them make a more informed decision on what CCA to choose as their actual CCAs which will begin in Semester 2.
