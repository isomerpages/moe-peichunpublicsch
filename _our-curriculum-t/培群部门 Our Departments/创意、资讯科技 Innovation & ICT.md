<b>Curriculum</b><br>
To prepare for an innovation-driven future, the Innovation and ICT department aims to nurture creative and innovative individuals grounded in sound values, growth mindset and a future-oriented outlook.

Information Communication Technologies (ICT) is a supporting platform which all departments ride on to provide a holistic education to the students in Pei Chun Public School. This is an important enabler in promoting innovation in our school.

In Pei Chun, we develop and align our activities and programmes by creating supportive structures that promote school improvements through collaboration works across the different departments. This also encourages our staff to develop innovative programmes. One of our key signature programmes, the Bilingual Media Studies Project (BMSP) is our school-wide project work initiative.

In Pei Chun, we have our 4 “I” Innovation Framework which is developed by integrating Design Thinking and Problem Solving skills. There are four stages of problem-solving skills in our PCPS Innovation Framework. They are:
1.	Identify the Problem
2.	Ideate Alternatives
3.	Implement the Best Strategy
4.	Improve on the Solution

<b>Instruction</b><br>
The innovative programmes in Pei Chun aim to provide students with the environment that supports and encourages innovation. It is delivered to develop in our students, different skill set, experiences and perspectives to encourage creativity and new ways to do things. The integration of curriculum and co-curriculum and the use of Information Communication Technology (ICT) help students strengthen and develop their innovative skills by encouraging student inquiry and experimentation, and greater ownership of their own learning process.

<b>Innovation & ICT Curriculum Supporting Bilingual Media Studies Project (BMSP)</b><br>
The department supports BMSP that uses various subjects and ICT skills to bring the various aspects of the curriculum together, helping our students see the interconnectedness of their learning. The department works with the other departments to provide students with learning experiences in coding. Through the coding lessons, students are encouraged to go beyond the textbooks to work collaboratively, critically, creatively and independently to communicate their findings, to construct a better network of knowledge and skills for the 21st century.

<b>Infusion of Baseline ICT Standards & New Media Literacies Skills (NMLS) into various subjects</b><br>
Baseline ICT Standards and New Media Literacies Skills are integrated with various subjects to make learning more effective, engaging and interesting for our students. Through this integration, opportunities are provided to enrich students’ learning, communication and problem solving skills through the effective use of technology.

<b>Assessment</b><br>
The assessment is in the form of artefacts or performance tasks completed by the students. The students’ ability to produce artefacts and performance are a measure of competencies levels the students have achieved.
