**Curriculum**<br>
The Physical Education (PE) Curriculum will lay a strong foundation for a lifelong pursuit of a physically active and healthy lifestyle. It will create more opportunities for our pupils to participate in recreational sports and help develop their skills, values and competencies. Students will be exposed to a range of learning areas (table below) in PE.

Besides the above, the school also carries out other initiatives to further enhance our pupils’ learning:
* Loan of sports equipment for play during recess.
* Termly structured physical and health education programmes.
* Sports Exposure Programmes, e.g. Archery, Tchoukball, Foundational Wushu.
* Enrichment Activities e.g. Swimming
* P5 Outdoor Leadership and Adventure Learning Camp (residential).
* Sports Carnival during Children’s Day celebration.
* Health Promoting Activities with Partners (e.g. Health Promotion Board, Singapore Heart Foundation).

**Co-Curriculum**<br>
The CCA Programme provides students with a platform to discover their interests and talents. Well-organised and implemented, they can fuel in the individual a life-long love for a particular activity, be it a sport or a musical pursuit. CCA also offer excellent platforms for students to learn core values, social and emotional competencies and the emerging 21st Century Competencies. These help the individual to lead a balanced life in adulthood. 
Our Primary 3 students get the opportunity to participate in a CCA Experience Programme, from which they can experience up to 3 CCAs over a span of a few weeks. This will help them make a more informed decision on what CCA to choose as their actual CCAs which will begin in Semester 2.
