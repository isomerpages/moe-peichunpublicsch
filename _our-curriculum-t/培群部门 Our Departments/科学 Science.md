**Aim** <br>
The Science Department aims to inspire students to seek scientific knowledge and equip them with competencies to meet the challenges of the 21st Century through the development of skills for scientific inquiry and innovation and build their foundation in scientific ethics. 
These goals are represented by the tagline Science for Life and Society and are central to the revised Science Curriculum Framework.

**Curriculum** <br>
We seek to nurture students’ natural curiosity in science and the natural world. Using the inquiry-based and hands-on exploratory approach, students can observe live specimens of plants and animals in the eco-garden and work in teams to conduct experiments in laboratories. Students also go on learning journeys to broaden their experiences beyond classroom, bringing about greater joy of learning. 

Eco-Science monitors lead the sharing of science experiments with fellow school mates during level recess. Students also have opportunities to pursue their interest in science, such as Pei Chun Creative Toy Competition, Science Olympiad, enrichment programmes and Co-curricular Activities, like Science and Gardening Club. 

**Assessment** <br>
Students are given regular feedback through formative assessments which include topical review at the end of the topics, practical sessions, group projects and oral class presentations, beyond pen-and-paper assessment. It helps to affirm students’ individual strengths and grows their confidence in Science mastery.
