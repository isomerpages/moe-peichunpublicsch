<b>Overview</b><br>
The Arts should be enjoyed by all students at Pei Chun Public School.

Our school arts curriculum is designed to provide as many varied experiences in the arts for our students. Students who like to pursue a greater interest in the arts can participate in our Aesthetics enrichment and/or take up a Visual & Performing Arts CCA.

<b>Arts Experiences @ Pei Chun Public</b><br>
<b>Art and Music Curriculum (All P1 - P6 Students)</b><br>
All students will have 2 periods of Art/Music each week (except 1 period a week for Music for P5 and 6 students). 

These are some of the key learning experiences during their Art & Music lessons. As a SAP school, we integrate Chinese cultural experiences in the curriculum for our students to provide them with a robust cultural experience in the arts.

<b>School-Based Aesthetics Programme</b><br>
<b>1. Celebrations of Learning</b><br>
This is a bi-termly event where we celebrate the arts and the learning of our students - from exhibitions, performances and hands-on activities where students immerse themselves in the arts through various formats.

<b>Design my student Diary Competition (Held in Term 4)</b><br>
Honouring the student’s voice is important for us. We invite students to submit an artwork based on a theme each year. The artworks are then selected by students and then included in the design of the cover pages, inserts and bookmark of the student diary each year - creating a student diary designed by students for students.
