<b><u>Student Management & Well-Being Department</u></b><br>
In Pei Chun, we believe in nurturing a culture of care where teachers can teach and students learn in a safe, orderly and caring environment. Good behaviour and effective behaviour management strategies maximise the opportunities for every child to develop to their fullest potential.

Key Programmes (Engaging the mass)<br>
* Positive Education messages 
* Growth Mindset 
* Morning and mass Assembly programmes / talks 
* Pei Chun Good Stories 
* Pei Chun Character Star Programme 
* CCE (Form Teacher Guidance Period) 
* Make-A-Difference Friday (promoting inclusivity) 


We adopt an educative approach which involves all school personnel to support and care for our students. This approach empowers our students to be actively involved in their character development. In enacting a positive and proactive approach to discipline, the school strives to:<br>
* Promote a safe and supportive environment and a culture of care, and prevent challenging behaviours from occurring;
* Address inappropriate behaviour promptly, and correct it before it affects students’ development and well-being;
* Replace inappropriate behaviour with prosocial, appropriate ones, and restore relationships with others hurt by their actions.   

Discipline is an educative process, and the goal is to instil self-discipline and good character in students. Disciplinary consequences serve as a proxy for consequences of the poor choices made. It is not punishment, and will be meted out fairly, firmly and appropriately.

Our school establishes rules and regulations for promoting good behaviour and ensuring a safe and conducive environment for the overall development of students. Parents / Guardians can refer to the Student Diary & Handbook for our set of school rules and regulations, and list of consequences.

<b><u>Supporting students with additional needs</u></b><br>
The school also believes that every student can learn. In Pei Chun, we have specialized personnel and programmes to provide timely and appropriate support to students with additional needs to achieve their full potential: <br>
* <b>Learning, behaviour and/ or emotional support</b> provided by our specialized team of SEN Officers and School Counsellors. This is in the form of individual or small group intervention or skills training.<br>
* <b>School programmes:</b> Learning Support Programme (P1 & P2), School-based Dyslexia Remediation Programme (P3 & P4), A.C.E for Life Programme (P5 & P6), to provide targeted support for these students.<br>
* <b>Partnering and engaging</b> with stakeholders (parents and the community, including collaboration with and referral to external agencies) in order to better support these students.
