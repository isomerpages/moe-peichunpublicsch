The Mathematics curriculum in Pei Chun Public School follows the Primary Mathematics Syllabus conceptualized by MOE, Singapore.

We aim to nurture our pupils to:<br>
* Acquire mathematical concepts and skills for everyday use and continuous learning in Mathematics
* Develop thinking, reasoning, communication, application and metacognitive skills through a mathematical approach to problem solving
* Build confidence and foster interest in Mathematics

At the end of 6 years in Pei Chun Public School, our pupils will be passionate and confident in the learning of Mathematics and they will be able to reason critically and communicate Mathematics effectively.

**Instruction**<br>
Mathematical problem solving is central to mathematics learning. It involves the acquisition and application of mathematics concepts and skills in a wide range of situations. To become effective and efficient problem solvers, our pupils learn and apply the STAR approach adopted from Polya’s problem-solving process.

**Assessments**<br>
Assessments are aligned to what pupils have learnt. Various modes of assessment such as pen-and-paper tests, performance tasks and journal writing are used to provide pupils opportunities to self-assess their learning and thinking process, to reflect on their strengths and weaknesses and what they can do to improve their learning. The assessments also provide feedback on pupils’ learning, their progress and allows for identification of misconceptions and areas for further instruction.
