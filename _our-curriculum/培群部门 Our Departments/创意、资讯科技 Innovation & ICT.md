Curriculum
To prepare for an innovation-driven future, the Innovation and ICT department aims to nurture creative and innovative individuals grounded in sound values, growth mindset and a future-oriented outlook.

Information Communication Technologies (ICT) is a supporting platform which all departments ride on to provide a holistic education to the students in Pei Chun Public School. This is an important enabler in promoting innovation in our school.

In Pei Chun, we develop and align our activities and programmes by creating supportive structures that promote school improvements through collaboration works across the different departments. This also encourages our staff to develop innovative programmes. One of our key signature programmes, the Bilingual Media Studies Project (BMSP) is our school-wide project work initiative.

In Pei Chun, we have our 4 “I” Innovation Framework which is developed by integrating Design Thinking and Problem Solving skills. There are four stages of problem-solving skills in our PCPS Innovation Framework. They are:
1.	Identify the Problem
2.	Ideate Alternatives
3.	Implement the Best Strategy
4.	Improve on the Solution

Instruction
The innovative programmes in Pei Chun aim to provide students with the environment that supports and encourages innovation. It is delivered to develop in our students, different skill set, experiences and perspectives to encourage creativity and new ways to do things. The integration of curriculum and co-curriculum and the use of Information Communication Technology (ICT) help students strengthen and develop their innovative skills by encouraging student inquiry and experimentation, and greater ownership of their own learning process.
