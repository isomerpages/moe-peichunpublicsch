**Aim** <br>
The Science Department aims to inspire students to seek scientific knowledge and equip them with the competencies to meet the challenges of the 21st century. Through the development of skills for scientific inquiry and innovation, as well as a strong foundation in scientific ethics, students are nurtured to apply science meaningfully in their daily lives. Central to this is the fostering of eco-stewardship, where students learn to care for the environment and make responsible decisions that contribute to a sustainable future. These goals are represented by the tagline Science for Life and Society and are at the heart of the revised Science Curriculum Framework.

**Curriculum** <br>
We seek to nurture students’ natural curiosity about science and the world around them. Through an inquiry-based and hands-on approach, students explore scientific concepts by observing live specimens, conducting experiments in teams, and embarking on learning journeys that extend learning beyond the classroom and spark joy in discovery.
Beyond the core curriculum, students are offered enrichment opportunities such as Fun with Science, Science Olympiad training, and the E2K Programme to further develop their passion and talent in science. To cultivate eco-stewardship, school-wide initiatives such as assembly talks and the Let’s Go Green Fiesta engage students in understanding environmental conservation, biodiversity, and recycling, empowering them to care for the environment and make a positive impact.


**Assessment** <br>
Students are given regular feedback through formative assessments which include topical review at the end of the topics, practical sessions, group projects and oral class presentations, beyond pen-and-paper assessment. It helps to affirm students’ individual strengths and grows their confidence in Science mastery.
