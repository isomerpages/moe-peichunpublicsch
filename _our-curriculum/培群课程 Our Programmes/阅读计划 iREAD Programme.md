As a collaborative effort between the English and Chinese Departments to cultivate a love for reading and enhance information literacy in students, the departments have developed an integrated reading programme called iRead. 

iRead is an activity-based reading programme that integrates the EL Reading Programme, the CL Reading Programme and the Library Instructional Programme within a single curriculum platform.  This whole school approach aims to encourage students to read, and is supported by a set of recommended texts, activity sheets and informal assessments.  It aims to develop in students a love for Reading (Enjoyment), provide an integrated platform for informal assessment (Achievement) and deliver a sustainable approach to develop students’ core skills within the curriculum (Development).
