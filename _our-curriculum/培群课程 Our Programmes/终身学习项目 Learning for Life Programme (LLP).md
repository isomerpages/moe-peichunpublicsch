The Pei Chun Leaders Programme is the school’s Learning for Life Programme that forms an integral part of the school’s Character and Citizenship education.

**Programme Objectives** <br>
This programme is guided by the Pei Chun Leadership Philosophy that drew wisdom from the Confucian classic “Great Learning”. Through this programme, students are instilled a sense of responsibility for themselves and others by demonstrating self-leadership (achieving personal effectiveness), social leadership (leading others with care and respect) and thought leadership (making a positive difference to the community). As part of the Pei Chun Leaders Programme, the school has also embarked on positive education that aims to promote lifelong learning through leveraging growth mindset, mindfulness and positive psychology. This has helped students broaden their perspective of learning as a lifelong process.

**Pei Chun Leadership Philosophy** <br>
Pei Chun Leadership Philosophy is strongly influenced by the Confucian classic “Great Learning” – 修身、齐家、治国、平天下 – Before one could take on the world, one’s own country must be well-governed first. Before one’s own country could be well-governed, one needs to ensure one’s own family is well in order first. Before one’s own family could be in order, one must begin with cultivating one’s virtue from within first. The direct relevance from the virtue of the individual, to the family, to the country and to the world in the “Great Learning” philosophy encapsulates the growth dimensions of the Pei Chun Leadership Philosophy from self to social and to thought leadership (Figure 1). It firmly believes that leadership begins with self. It is only when one can manage self (Self Leadership) that one can manage relationships effectively, treat/lead others with care and respect (Social Leadership), and make a positive difference to the community (Thought Leadership).

培群领导理念奠基于儒家经典《大学》中的“修身、齐家、治国、平天下”：要先丰富自己的学识和涵养，再把自己的家打理得井井有条，然后才能去管理国家，从而实现天下太平的理想。这句话中“个人”、“家庭”、“国家”、“世界”层层递进的关系，直接反映在培群领导理念的发展层级上，即要先修身养性（爱己），才能够与人和谐相处（爱人），进而为社区做出积极贡献，造福人群（爱众）。

**Programme Design** <br>
The school adopts a three-tiered approach to broaden students’ educational experiences in leadership development. This tiered approach ensures that the needs of the students are met at different levels through core and differentiated programmes.
