In Pei Chun, our Programme for Active Learning (PAL) provides a great emphasis on the development of social and emotional skills for Primary 1 and 2 pupils. In PAL, pupils are exposed to varied and fun learning experiences via the five domains: Sports and Games, Outdoor Education, Performing Arts, Drama and Visual Arts. 

Through the PAL programme, pupils will be able to
* Exhibit confidence and express themselves effectively;
* Exhibit curiosity and positive attitudes to learn; and
* Enjoy group experiences and teamwork and thus exhibiting cooperation with teammates.

Each PAL module consists of a 10-week programme.
