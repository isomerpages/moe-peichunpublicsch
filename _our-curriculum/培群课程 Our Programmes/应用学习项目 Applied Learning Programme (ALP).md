<b>Applied Learning Programme – Bilingual Media Studies Programme (BMSP)</b>

Applied Learning Programme (ALP) helps students appreciate the relevance and value of what they are learning in the academic curriculum to the real world and develop stronger motivation and purpose to acquire knowledge and skills. The emphasis is on the application of thinking skills, integrating knowledge across subject disciplines, stretching the imagination and applying these in real-world settings in society and industries.

Pei Chun Public School’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) is Bilingual Media Studies Programme (BMSP). In line with MOE’s emphasis on a Student-Centric, Values-Driven education, Pei Chun embarked on Bilingual Media Studies Programme to offer our students more opportunities to pursue learning in line with their interests and deepen their 21st century competencies through applied learning experiences. It is our vision to see our students grow up to become confident communicators, self-directed learners, concerned citizens and active contributors to the nation.

Starting from 2015, BMSP is now an integral part of the school-based curriculum, complementing the national curriculum for English and Chinese language. Our Bilingual Media Studies Programme (BMSP) takes the form in these 4 areas:<br>
A. Skills and knowledge level-based training <br>
B. Coding Lessons to generate artefacts (outcome of learning) <br>
C. School Environment – Platforms <br>
D. Enrichment 

<b>Tier 1: Learning Opportunities for all</b><br>
In 2018, we have established the level skill-based training towards journalism starting with oratorical training in P2 SEL Speech & Drama during PAL, interview skills in P3, P4 Oratorical Basic Techniques Training and news reporting in P5. In addition, our teachers have come in with coding lessons and provide platforms for students to showcase learnt skills.　

<b>Tier Two: Specialised skill-based training</b><br>
The objective of having Enrichment programmes is to ensure that our students who are passionate about the languages are supported with platforms to sustain their enthusiasm and discover the joy of learning for both the languages. Platforms and opportunities are provided to this group of students to hone their skills and demonstrate their talents through school’s Bilingual Superstar, FM193.3 and hosting of visiting delegations from China, Taiwan and Hong Kong; and enrichment programmes like theatre and drama. Moving forward, we are refining the skilled-based training to include oratorical training and translation, with exposure at school level (emcee for school events, BMSP platforms) and national level (National Storytelling, Moo-O) to showcase their learnt skills.
