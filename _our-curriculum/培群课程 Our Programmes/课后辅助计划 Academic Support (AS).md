<p><strong>After School Academic Support (AS) – P3 to P6 </strong>
<br>The school is always committed to support our students in their journey
of acquiring knowledge and skills. The school adopts a targeted approach
to support students who did not meet the minimum requirements or are underperforming
in the subject. Only selected students will be requested to stay back after
school for AS on Tuesdays and/or Thursdays from 2 pm to 3.30 pm.</p>
<p>The objective of this programme is to close students’ learning gaps so
as to enable them to achieve better progress in their learning. Thus, the
class size for the academic support lessons is kept small to ensure effective
remediation. Academic support is not an extension of the school curriculum.
Rather, they will focus on the mastery of the concepts/topics taught.</p>
<p>Teachers will monitor the performance of the students closely and students
will be discharged from AS when they have demonstrated the ability to keep
up with the pace of learning in class.</p>
<p>The Academic Support lessons will commence in:</p>

<p>If your child/ward is identified to attend the AS, he/she will receive
a consent form and the detailed schedule of the weekly lessons from the
Form Teacher.&nbsp; Please make the necessary arrangements (e.g. transportation

<p>We seek your cooperation to inform your child’s/ward’s academic support
teacher(s) if your child/ward needs to be excused from any lesson as attendance
will be taken.</p>
<p><strong><u>Programme for other students not in the Academic Support</u></strong>
<br>For the rest of the students who are managing well in their subjects,
the school will be conceptualising enrichment programmes for them. It will
be modular and are on an opt-in basis. The focus of these modular enrichment
programmes will be to expose students to learning beyond grades and examinations.
More details will be provided at a later time.
<br>
<br><strong>AS takes precedence over enrichment programme. If your child/ward is selected for AS, they will have to give up their place in the enrichment programme.</strong>&nbsp;
<br>For clarifications, please contact your child’s/ward’s Form Teacher or
the AS in-charge below:</p>
