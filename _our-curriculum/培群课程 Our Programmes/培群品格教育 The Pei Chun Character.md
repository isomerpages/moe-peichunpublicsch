Character Education has always been the heart of Pei Chun’s education. The school values (Passion, Teamwork, Respect, Care, Initiative and Innovation) and motto (Courtesy, Justice, Honesty, Honour and Gratitude) are fundamental for a person of good character and socially responsible citizen. They guide students to discern between right and wrong, help them to make responsible choices and become more aware of their roles in society.
