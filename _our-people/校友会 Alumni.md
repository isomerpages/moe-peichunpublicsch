On 1 April 1994, a group of enthusiastic ex-students of the school formed a pro tem committee to draft a constitution for submission to the Registrar of Societies together with an application for registration of the proposed association. Following the approval of our application on 24 August 1994, the Pei Chun Old Students’ Association was officially established. The immediate tasks then were to embark on a large-scale membership drive and hold a general meeting to elect the first Executive Committee.

For the past years since its inception, the association has been able to function smoothly with the full support of its members and, most of all, the complete dedication of members of its successive Executive Committees. Its membership, now standing at more than 900, has been growing steadily. The associaton had since been renamed as Pei Chun Alumni Association.
