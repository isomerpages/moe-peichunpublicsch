Home-Based Learning
-------------------

_Updated 28 June 2021._

**Home-Based Learning Overview**

The purpose of our school’s Home-Based Learning (HBL) programme is to ensure that our students continue to learn and mitigate the loss in curriculum time during school closure. Our HBL programme covers both academic and student development domains (e.g. CCE); and both examinable and non-examinable subjects to provide a holistic learning experience for our students while they learn from home.

HBL assignments can include both online and offline assignments. Every child will have up to 4 hours of HBL each day. Each day will comprise of:

<table style="box-sizing: inherit; border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; width: 785px;"><tbody style="box-sizing: inherit;"><tr style="box-sizing: inherit; background-color: rgb(237, 237, 235);"><td style="box-sizing: inherit; padding: 10px;"><strong style="box-sizing: inherit; font-weight: bold;">Offline learning (2 hours)<br style="box-sizing: inherit;"></strong>– Worksheets<br style="box-sizing: inherit;">– Workbook Exercises<br style="box-sizing: inherit;">– Art/PE activities<br style="box-sizing: inherit;">– Other activities that do not require the&nbsp; use of devices</td><td style="box-sizing: inherit; padding: 10px;"><strong style="box-sizing: inherit; font-weight: bold;">Online learning (2 hours)<br style="box-sizing: inherit;"></strong>– Student Learning Space (SLS)<br style="box-sizing: inherit;">– Google Classroom<br style="box-sizing: inherit;">– Videos<br style="box-sizing: inherit;">– Face-to-Face Video Conferencing<br style="box-sizing: inherit;">&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table>
