Applied Learning Programme (ALP)
--------------------------------

_Updated on 29 June 2021._

**Applied Learning Programme – Bilingual Media Studies Programme (BMSP)**

**应用学习项目－双语传媒课程**

Applied Learning Programme (ALP) helps students appreciate the relevance and value of what they are learning in the academic curriculum to the real world and develop stronger motivation and purpose to acquire knowledge and skills. The emphasis is on the application of thinking skills, integrating knowledge across subject disciplines, stretching the imagination and applying these in real-world settings in society and industries.

应用学习项目旨在帮助学生将他们在学术课程中所学习到的内容和价值观与现实世界相结合，并培养更强大的学习动力和目的，以获取知识和技能。应用学习项目的重点是思维技能的应用、整合学科领域的知识，扩展想象力，并将其应用于社会和各行业中。

Pei Chun Public School’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) is Bilingual Media Studies Programme (BMSP). In line with MOE’s emphasis on a Student-Centric, Values-Driven education, Pei Chun embarked on Bilingual Media Studies Programme to offer our students more opportunities to pursue learning in line with their interests and deepen their 21st century competencies through _applied learning experiences_. It is our vision to see our students grow up to become confident communicators, self-directed learners, concerned citizens and active contributors to the nation.

培群的应用学习项目是双语传媒课程。为配合教育部以学生为本，价值为导向的教育方针，培群开办了双语传媒课程，通过体验式学习，提供深究和拓展知识的机会，同时提升21世纪技能。这项课程旨在培养学生有自信地以中英双语沟通，自主学习，关怀国家，并积极为国家做出贡献。

Starting from 2015, BMSP is now an integral part of the school-based curriculum, complementing the national curriculum for English and Chinese language. Our Bilingual Media Studies Programme (BMSP) takes the form in these 4 areas:

A.     Skills and knowledge level-based training 

B.     Coding Lessons to generate artefacts (outcome of learning) 

C.     School Environment – Platforms 

D.     Enrichment 

自2015年起，双语传媒课程已融入现有的英文和华文的课程内，成为我校的重点校本课程。

双语传媒课程包括以下四个项目：

*   各年级的知识及技能培训
*   编码课程
*   学校所提供的语言学习环境
*   增益课程

**Tier 1: Learning Opportunities for all**

In 2018, we have established the level skill-based training towards journalism starting with oratorical training in P2 SEL Speech & Drama during PAL, interview skills in P3, P4 Oratorical Basic Techniques Training and news reporting in P5. In addition, our teachers have come in with coding lessons and provide platforms for students to showcase learnt skills.　

**第一层级：为全体学生提供学习的机会**

2018年，我校为学生提供了以新闻学为导向的培训课，即融入艺体陶冶课程中的二年级口语演艺课（华文），三年级小记者培训课（英文），四年级口语培训课（华文）及五年级小记者培训课（华文）。此外，我校的老师也设计了编码课以及提供平台让学生展示所学习到的技能。

**Tier Two:** **Specialised skill-based training**

The objective of having Enrichment programmes is to ensure that our students who are passionate about the languages are supported with platforms to sustain their enthusiasm and discover the joy of learning for both the languages. Platforms and opportunities are provided to this group of students to hone their skills and demonstrate their talents through school’s Bilingual Superstar, FM193.3 and hosting of visiting delegations from China, Taiwan and Hong Kong; and enrichment programmes like theatre and drama. Moving forward, we are refining the skilled-based training to include oratorical training and translation, with exposure at school level (emcee for school events, BMSP platforms) and national level (National Storytelling, Moo-O) to showcase their learnt skills.

**第二层级：专门的技能培训**

为了帮助那些对学习两种语文感兴趣的学生维持学习的热忱及发掘学习的乐趣，我校安排了增益课程及应用语文的各种平台。通过双语之星平台、193.3广播台、接待来自中国、台湾及香港的访问团、演艺课程以及到新加坡报业中心的学习之旅，这群学生得以磨练他们的语言技能及展现他们的才华。展望未来，我们将改进目前的技能培训，以加入口语培训课、翻译课，让学生有更多机会在校内（在学校主办的活动上担任司仪、双语传媒课程的平台）及校外（全国讲故事比赛、Moo-O数码故事朗读平台等）学以致用。
