PAL Programme
-------------

In Pei Chun, our Programme for Active Learning (PAL) provides a greater emphasis on non-academic learning for Primary 1 and 2 pupils. In PAL, pupils are exposed to varied and fun learning experiences in the four domains: Sports and Games, Outdoor Education, Performing Arts and Visual Arts. Pupils also learn socio-emotional competencies such as respecting others and responsible decision making.

After going through 2 years of PAL, pupils will be able to

*   Exhibit **confidence** and **express** themselves **effectively;**
*   Exhibit **curiosity** and **positive attitudes** to learn; and
*   Enjoy **group experiences** and **teamwork** and thus exhibiting **cooperation** with teammates.

Each PAL module is conducted for 1.5 hours per week with each module lasting 10 weeks.
