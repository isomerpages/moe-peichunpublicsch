No school can achieve great things without the support of her stakeholders.

The Pei Chun Parentsâ€™ Support Group is made up of many dedicated mothers and fathers who generously give of their time and effort event after event, project after project.

Our parents have worked closely with our teachers and in so doing, demonstrate a kind of cohesion and collaboration which our pupils cannot learn from any textbook.
