Pei Chun Public School was established in 1933 by a group of Hainanese to provide education to the children of the Chinese working class.  It became a government-aided school in 1956.  With its unique Chinese culture and rich tradition as a Chinese medium school in its early days, Pei Chun was accorded the Special Assistance Plan (SAP) school status in 1990.  In 2001, Pei Chun moved to its current premises in Toa Payoh Lorong 7.  Through the years, the school prides itself in providing an all-round bilingual and holistic education to children in Toa Payoh.

Since its establishment in 1933, Pei Chun has remained true to its mission to nurture responsible citizens who will contribute to society.  Leveraging on its rich tradition and the pervasive Chinese culture, Pei Chun seeks to instil moral values in pupils and enhance bilingualism to maximise pupils’ potential. The ethos of developing every pupil to be a ‘Passionate and Cultured Learner; Proactive and Caring Leader’ also underpins all our educational processes and programmes.  The two South Zone Centres of Excellence to promote the teaching and learning of Sports and Chinese Language in South Zone schools is yet another testament of the school’s unwavering quest to build a culture of excellence.

培群校史

1933 年，一批海南先贤为了让族群子弟接受教育，创办了公立培群学校。1956 年，培群成为政府辅助学校。以中华传统文化及价值观为办学特色的培群于 1990 年受遴选为特选学校之一。2001 年，培群搬迁至目前坐落于大巴窑七巷的校舍。这么多年来，培群立志于为学生提供全面的双语教育。

由始至今，培群秉承着培育富有责任感公民的使命。为全面激发学生的潜力，我们以优良传统文化为根基，灌输学生正确的价值观，并提供学习双语的良好环境。让孩子们成为“好学、优雅、有文化的学生；积极、主动、有爱心的领袖”是培群对教育的承诺，也是校内所有教学活动与计划的指南针。培群的两所卓越中心――南区卓越体育中心及南区华文教学研习中心，见证了我们力求卓越的成就与使命。
