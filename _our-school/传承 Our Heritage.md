A School Started by the Community for the Community

Established in 1933, Pei Chun Public School was started by a group of Hainanese who wanted to provide an education for the children of the Chinese working class. As the only school in Singapore bearing the word "Public", the school name clearly signifies the intent of its founders - a school started by the community for the community. Such conviction remains unchanged over the past 85 years and it continues to deepen as the school forges ahead. 

The school became a government-aided school in 1956. With its unique Chinese Culture and rich tradition as a Chinese medium school in its early days, the school was accorded the Special Assistance Plan (SAP) status in 1990. In 2001, the school moved to its current premies in Toa Payoh Lorong 7. Through the years, the school prides itself in providing a bilingual and holistic education.
