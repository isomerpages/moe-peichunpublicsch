A School Started by the Community for the Community

Established in 1933, Pei Chun Public School was started by a group of Hainanese who wanted to provide an education for the children of the Chinese working class. As the only school in Singapore bearing the word "Public", the school name clearly signifies the intent of its founders - a school started by the community for the community. Such conviction remains unchanged over the past 85 years and it continues to deepen as the school forges ahead. 

The school became a government-aided school in 1956. With its unique Chinese Culture and rich tradition as a Chinese medium school in its early days, the school was accorded the Special Assistance Plan (SAP) status in 1990. In 2001, the school moved to its current premies in Toa Payoh Lorong 7. Through the years, the school prides itself in providing a bilingual and holistic education.

In 2017, the school embarked on the Primary Education Review and Implementation (PERI) Upgrading so as to enhance its infrastructure to facilitate the school transition to a single session school. In view of the extensive upgrading works, the school moved to a holding site at 580 Toa Payoh East at the end of 2016. This shift marked an important milestone in the school's journey as new facilities were added to the school site such as an indoor playing field which is a first of its kind in Singapore primary schools. With the enhanced infrastructure, Pei Chun is well positioned to enrich the learning experiences of its students so as to achieve its mission of providing a holistic education for all students. The school is scheduled to move back to Toa Payoh Lorong 7 in 2019 and transit to a single session school in 2020. 

Pei Chun could not be what it is today if not for the support of its stakeholders - parents, staff, alumni, School Management Committee as well as various partners in education. With their strong support and partnership, Pei Chun will continue to live up to its name and its founders' vision of providing quality education for future generations, reaffirming the intent of its founders of being a school started by the community for the community.
